## How to compile
You need gcc and make
Then just run make. A binary will be created inside build folder.

## How to run tests
For unit tests you need CMocka installed. For integration tests you need perl. You need bash for both.

1.- Go to ./test folder
2.- Run 'sh ./run.sh' to run only unit tests. Run 'sh ./run.sh integration' to run both.
