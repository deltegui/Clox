Poject to learn how to create interpreters and compilers.

# CLox
CLox is the lox interpreter made with C using a stack-based virtual machine and with one step compiler. Is inside the clox folder. To compile you only need gcc or other C compiler and Make. Just run make to build the interpreter.

# GoLox
GoLox is the lox interpreter made with Golang. It's a abstract syntax tree interpreter, so its easy to understand but so slow. You need Go 1.13 to build the interpreter. Just run make to compile it.
